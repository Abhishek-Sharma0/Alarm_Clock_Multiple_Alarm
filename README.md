# Alarm_Clock_Multiple_Alarm

An alarm clock is a useful tool for setting reminders and ensuring that you wake up on time. With the advent of web development, it is now possible to create an alarm clock using JavaScript. This type of alarm clock can be accessed through a web browser, making it convenient to use on any device with internet access.

The basic functionality of a JavaScript alarm clock is to set a specific time for the alarm to go off and display a message or play a sound when that time is reached. This can be achieved using the JavaScript Date object and the setTimeout or setInterval functions.
